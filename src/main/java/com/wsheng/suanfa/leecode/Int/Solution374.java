 *
     * 374	Guess Number Higher or Lower

 We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

 I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

 Every time you guess wrong, Iâ€™ll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

 You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):

 -1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!

 Example :
 Input: n = 10, pick = 6
 Output: 6
